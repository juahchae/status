Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

I imported the time module to work with time in Python. I introduced the user to the typing game with a "Welcome to the Typing Masterclass. Press Enter to start typing." I calculated the words per minute (WPM) with elapsed time, character count, and word count. So far, the user is able to write their own sentence, which then the program calculates the WPM, instead of giving a random set of sentences. 

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I need to generate a list of sentences with words and characters. It needs to be randomized for the user. I need to make the characters white, red, and green. If red, then the user input the wrong character. If green, then the user input the right character. 
I need the program to detect when the user finishes the sentence with punctuation, instead of having to press Enter again, which might affect the WPM. 

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?
